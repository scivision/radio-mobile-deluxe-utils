# Radio Mobile Deluxe Utils

Helper programs for Roger Coude\'s Radio Mobile Deluxe.

Antenna [Pattern Interpolator](./Antenna_interp.py) reads a .csv file (perhaps you created in Excel or Libreoffice Calc) from FCC license antenna pattern data and interpolates it on a 1 degree grid in the Radio Mobile Deluxe .ant format.
